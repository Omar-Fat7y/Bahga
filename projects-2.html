                    We start our black tour with the domes that belong to the
                    two wives of Sultan Al-Naser Mohamed, The Tomb and the
                    remains of the Khanqah of Umm Anuk that dates back before
                    1348 AH / 749 AD, Bahari Mamluk Era. It’s regarded as the
                    first women Khanqah that was constructed by the Sultan
                    Al-Naser for his wife Khawand Tughay al-Nasiryah Umm Anok,
                    She became from just a slave to the favorite wife of Sultan
                    Al-Nasir as he gave her the title of Khawand” that means the
                    first lady of the country, Al-Maqrizy said that Sultan
                    Al-Naser didn’t love any woman as he loved Umm Anok. And
                    probably the sister of prince Aqbogha Abd el-Wahed. Inside
                    the remains of the khanqah there’s Qur’anic inscriptions
                    part of the throne verse from Qur’an written on it inlaid in
                    with blue, green and white mosaic tiles. <br />
                    The dome of Tulbay that lies in front of the dome of umm
                    Anuk. It dates back before 1364 AH / 765 AD, Bahari Mamluk
                    Era. It was constructed by Bahari Mamlouk sultan An-Naser
                    for his wife princess Tulbay bent Abdullah al-Nasirya. The
                    Tomb contains the dome where the princess is buried that
                    shows the skillfulness of the Mamlouk architecture. Inside
                    the dome there’s remains of Qur’anic inscriptions. The
                    existence of the 2 domes facing each other is giving them
                    amazing view.

                  <p>
                    Here where our story begins. This symmetrical Khanqah was
                    constructed in 803 to 813 AH/1400 to 1410 AD, the era of the
                    Burji Mamluks. It was constructed by Sultan Al Naser Faraj
                    Ibn Barquq to fulfill his father Sultan Barquq's wish as he
                    wanted to be buried in the northern cemetery near the Sufi
                    Sheikhs’ tombs. Sultan Faraj Ibn Barquq ascended the throne
                    when he was thirteen after his father's death. He decided to
                    face the danger of the Mongol but he wasn't brave enough
                    like his father. His reign ended by stabbing him to death.
                    Sultan Barquq was the first Mamluk sultan to be buried in
                    this cemetery beside Sheikh Al-Aref Belah Al-Hadramy. This
                    building is very symmetrical building that was rare in the
                    architecture of this period and was called the Twin Mosque.
                    Sultan Faraj was the first one to build a complex in the
                    Qarafa and Barquq was the first Mamluk Sultan be buried
                    there. <br />The complex consists of a Khanqah for Sufis,
                    two Sabils, two Kuttabs, two mausoleums, two domes, two
                    minarets, and a congregational mosque which contains the
                    stone pulpit of Qaitbay that imitates the wood and three
                    prayer niches. The Khanqah contains a courtyard and colorful
                    glass windows. In addition to two decorative mausoleums with
                    domes. It was restored in modern times.

                  <p>
                    In El Ashraf Street there is the complex of the great sultan
                    Al Ashraf Barsbay and 3 wonderful domes, dome of Qurqumas
                    which moved to here after it was attached to Al-Hakim
                    Mosque, dome of Ganibek who was a symbol of loyalty to his
                    Sultan and the dome of brother of sultan Al Ashraf Amir
                    Yashbk Al Mahdy. Complex Al-Ashraf dates back to 835
                    AH/1433AD, reign of sultan Al Ashraf Barsbay, Burji Mamluk
                    era. It was built by the panther king Barsbey who was mamluk
                    of Sultan Barquq then became sultan in 1422. He was warrior
                    and builder sultan and his greatest achievement was the
                    conquest of Cyprus after 3 campaigns until it became under
                    his control and he humiliated its King and put his crown in
                    his complex at Al-Moez and the importance of the complex is
                    from the importance of its owner who was buried in it.
                    <br />
                    The complex consists of mausoleum with a wonderful Dome that
                    is covered with geometrical star patterns, Khanqah and two
                    Sabils but the mosque was used as Madrassa. At the mosque,
                    we can see rectangular area from the main entrance leads to
                    the prayer hall with two iwans and mihrab from el Ghamri
                    mosque and there is a door enters to the dome and there is
                    the Khanqah with two iwans and two courts which contains
                    dome of Amir Yashbk Al Mahdy.

                  <h2>Dome of "Don’t Know”</h2>
                  <p>
                    This dome belongs to sultan " Don't Know “, who was afraid
                    to simply interact in the internal affairs of Egypt by
                    answering every question with only one phrase “I don`t know”
                    so the Egyptians called him sultan "Don't Know" or "Bakhsha"
                    in Turkish language which later on was transferred to our
                    common Arabic as "Ma'rafsh“. The dome dates back to 904 AH /
                    1498 AD, Burji Mamluk era. It was founded by sultan el-Zahir
                    Qansuah Abu el-Sa’id who ruled Egypt for only one year and
                    was famous for Sultan Ma’rafsh. Another interesting story
                    about this specific dome tells us that it was called "The
                    guardian dome" or 'Qubbet el-Ghafir’ in Arabic after the
                    person responsible for the whole Qarafa who was the first
                    inhabitant person to live in the cemetery & inside this
                    specific dome, so whenever anyone needed this man, they
                    found him here. <br />
                    The dome is so beautiful of a triple arrow design and the
                    rectangular pattern at the corners of the transition zone
                    are unusual. The dome is also regarded a unique dome
                    especially because it lies in the middle of the street
                    surrounded by cars all day also there are lamps used at
                    night to enlighten the dome and surrounded by a new sidewalk
                    in order to avoid accidents or damage to the dome. It was
                    added specific type of implement that doesn`t require water
                    to preserve the dome.

                  <p>
                    Egypt decided to adorn the Egyptian pound by the magnificent
                    complex of the one who succeeded in perpetuating his name.
                    It dates back to 877-879 AH/1472-1474 AD, the reign of the
                    "Master of Islamic architecture" Sultan Qaytbey, The Burji
                    Mamluk Era. Sultan Sayf Al-Din Al-Ashraf Qaytbay indulged
                    his love of architecture by having a funerary complex built
                    for himself in addition to the 85 buildings around the
                    Muslim world; 17 were built in Egypt alone. That’s why
                    Sultan Qaytbay is considered to be "The Master of Islamic
                    Architecture".<br />
                    It is the largest complex in the whole area that still
                    preserves many of its details and it helped in showing the
                    original form of the complex while comparing to the others.
                    The mosque has a unique decoration of mandala art inlaid
                    with beautiful colors in the central skylight. The most
                    unique feature in the mosque that there is a footprint
                    attributed to the prophet. As for the elements of the
                    Complex: (Bab Qaytbay-Maq'ad Qaytbay-Hawd Qaytbay- Rab'
                    Qaytbey-Mausoleum and madrasa of Qaytbey-Sabil-kuttab
                    Qaytbey). All the complex restored by Antiquities
                    Preservation Committee and Khedive Abbas but the most
                    important restorations made by ARCHiNOS that also started
                    the cultural programme by organizing events in and around
                    the Maq‘ad.

                    Once you enter El-Qarafa these complexes will catch your
                    eyes immediately. First, The complex of Inal which dates
                    back to 855 AH- 860 AH / 1451 AD -1456 AD, reign of Sultan
                    Inal. Al-Ashraf Inal was one of Burji mamluks who was
                    Illiterate and Parsimonious even on himself. He was known as
                    Inal Al-Agrod because he doesn`t have a beard and the first
                    one to bring the Julban Mamluks. It is the only complex that
                    represents different ranks in the life of one sultan and
                    even though it is built for a sultan but from glance the
                    great anomaly in its construction is striking. The complex
                    consists of Qubba (Mausoleum), mosque-madrasa, Sabil,
                    minaret and Khanqah. The design of this complex is totally
                    constructed anomaly and clearly appeared in constructing its
                    components separately and then attached with a wall which
                    gave him great irregularity in its facade installation.
                    <br />
                    Attaching to it the Complex of Qurqumas dating back to 911
                    AH-913 AH / 1505 AD -1507 AD, reign of Sultan Qansuh
                    al-Ghuri, Burji Mamluk era. Qurqumas was the
                    commander-in-chief of the armies. It the only surviving
                    complex that still have a palace in a funeral complex in a
                    good condition. It was restored by the Polish-Egyptian
                    mission and they found more than 100 skeletons in the crypts
                    of the complex.
